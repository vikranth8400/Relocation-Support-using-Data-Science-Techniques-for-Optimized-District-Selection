# Relocation-Support-using-Data-Science-Techniques-for-Optimized-District-Selection

This project was developed as part of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone on Coursera.

## Project Overview
This project aims to support relocation service providers by creating a ranked list of districts in São Paulo, Brazil, based on family relocation needs. Using data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), geospatial visualization, SQL queries, clustering techniques, and interactive dashboards, we provide a comprehensive recommendation system for selecting the most suitable districts.
